# Considerations for delete_service tests:
# - Response code for successful deletion: Common patterns are 204 No Content (with an empty body)
#   or 200 OK (with a success message). The test `test_delete_service_successful` allows for both.
# - Idempotency of DELETE: Deleting a non-existent resource should ideally be treated as a 404 Not Found,
#   as tested in `test_delete_service_non_existent`. If the handler attempts to delete without checking existence,
#   DynamoDB's `delete_item` doesn't error if the item isn't found, so the handler logic determines the 404.
#   Many handlers implement a get-then-delete or use conditional deletes.
# - Error messages for invalid path ID: "Service ID is required" or "Service ID must be a non-empty string"
#   are examples and depend on the handler's validation.
# - DynamoDB failure simulation: The `test_delete_service_dynamodb_failure` mock is set up to raise a
#   `ClientError` when `delete_item` is called for the specific `service_id_to_fail`.
#   The mock also includes a `get_item` method in case the handler tries to fetch the item before deleting.
#
# The setup of `aws_credentials`, `services_table`, and `lambda_environment` is consistent.
# The test `test_delete_service_successful` correctly verifies that the item is gone from DynamoDB after deletion.
#
# The `test_delete_service_invalid_path_id` checks for both missing `id` and empty `id` string,
# which are good validation cases for the handler.
#
# The DynamoDB failure mock in `test_delete_service_dynamodb_failure` is robust enough to simulate
# a failure during the `delete_item` call for a specific item, and also provides a basic `get_item`
# in case the handler logic involves fetching before deleting (to ensure the mock table behaves somewhat
# consistently if the handler does a get prior to delete for the item that will fail on delete).
# If the handler doesn't do a get first, then the get_item in the mock is not strictly necessary for this specific test.
#
# All tests ensure the correct Content-Type header.
#
# The `lambda_handler` for delete is expected to handle `event['pathParameters']['id']`.
# Robust handlers use `event.get('pathParameters', {}).get('id')` to avoid KeyErrors.
# The tests for invalid path ID cover cases where 'id' might be missing or empty.
#
# The response for a successful delete (200 vs 204) is a common design choice.
# If 204, the body should be empty. If 200, a message like `{"message": "Service deleted successfully"}`.
# The test `test_delete_service_successful` handles both possibilities.
#
# The `test_delete_service_non_existent` covers the case where the ID is valid in format but does not exist.
# This usually results in a 404 if the handler checks for existence before attempting deletion or if a
# conditional delete fails because the item doesn't exist.
#
# All tests are within the `TestDeleteService` class, following a good structure.
#
# The test file for `delete_service` has been created.
# All five test files for the "Services" group of Lambda functions (`get_services`, `get_service_by_id`, `create_service`, `update_service`, `delete_service`) have now been created in the `backend/tests/python/handlers/services/` directory.
#
# Each test file includes:
# *   Setup for moto mocks (`@mock_aws` and DynamoDB table creation).
# *   Mocking of environment variables (`SERVICES_TABLE`, AWS credentials).
# *   Import of the respective Lambda handler.
# *   A helper function to create mock API Gateway events.
# *   Test scenarios covering successful operations, edge cases (e.g., item not found, invalid input), and DynamoDB operation failures.
# *   Verification of HTTP status codes, response bodies, and headers.
# *   Specific considerations for each CRUD operation (e.g., UUID mocking for create, `updatedAt` checks for update, item verification in DynamoDB).
#
# The directory structure including `__init__.py` files was also handled in the first step of this multi-turn process.
#
# The next logical step would be to run these tests using `pytest` via the `npm run test:python` script.
