# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to modernize and standardize the UI/UX across the entire healthcare application by implementing a comprehensive design system. The current application suffers from inconsistent styling, incomplete dark mode implementation, varying table designs, inconsistent header sizes, and fragmented component usage. This modernization will create a cohesive, accessible, and maintainable user interface that provides an excellent user experience across all devices and themes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Unified Design System Implementation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a comprehensive design system with standardized components, so that I can build consistent interfaces efficiently across the entire application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing new features THEN the system SHALL provide a complete set of unified components (buttons, cards, forms, tables, layouts)
2. WHEN using design tokens THEN the system SHALL enforce consistent spacing, typography, colors, and border radius values throughout the application
3. WHEN accessing component documentation THEN the system SHALL provide clear usage guidelines and examples for all unified components
4. WHEN migrating from legacy components THEN the system SHALL provide migration utilities and clear mapping between old and new components

### Requirement 2: Complete Dark Mode Implementation

**User Story:** As a user, I want full dark mode support across all components and pages, so that I can use the application comfortably in low-light environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN switching to dark mode THEN all components SHALL display appropriate dark theme colors and contrasts
2. WHEN using interactive elements in dark mode THEN hover states, focus states, and active states SHALL be clearly visible and accessible
3. WHEN viewing tables, cards, and forms in dark mode THEN the system SHALL maintain proper contrast ratios for accessibility compliance
4. WHEN the system preference changes THEN the application SHALL automatically adapt to the user's preferred color scheme
5. WHEN switching themes THEN the transition SHALL be smooth without visual glitches or layout shifts

### Requirement 3: Standardized Table Components

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent table styling and functionality across all data views, so that I can efficiently navigate and understand information regardless of which page I'm viewing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing any data table THEN the system SHALL use consistent header styling, row spacing, and typography
2. WHEN interacting with table rows THEN hover states, selection states, and sorting indicators SHALL be uniform across all tables
3. WHEN viewing tables on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL provide responsive layouts that maintain usability
4. WHEN tables contain actions THEN button styling and positioning SHALL be consistent across all table implementations
5. WHEN tables are empty THEN the system SHALL display consistent empty state messaging and styling

### Requirement 4: Consistent Page Headers and Typography

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent page headers and typography hierarchy, so that I can easily understand the information architecture and navigate the application intuitively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing any page THEN page titles SHALL use consistent typography scale and spacing
2. WHEN navigating between sections THEN header hierarchy (H1, H2, H3, etc.) SHALL follow a logical and consistent pattern
3. WHEN viewing page actions THEN button placement and styling SHALL be uniform across all pages
4. WHEN reading content THEN text sizing, line height, and spacing SHALL provide optimal readability on all devices
5. WHEN viewing breadcrumbs or navigation elements THEN styling SHALL be consistent across the entire application

### Requirement 5: Responsive and Accessible Design

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the application to be fully accessible and responsive, so that I can use it effectively regardless of my device or assistive technology.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN all interactive elements SHALL have visible focus indicators and logical tab order
2. WHEN using screen readers THEN all components SHALL provide appropriate ARIA labels and semantic markup
3. WHEN viewing on mobile devices THEN touch targets SHALL be appropriately sized and spaced for easy interaction
4. WHEN checking color contrast THEN all text and interactive elements SHALL meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
5. WHEN resizing the browser THEN layouts SHALL adapt smoothly without breaking or becoming unusable

### Requirement 6: Performance and Maintainability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the design system to be performant and maintainable, so that the application loads quickly and can be easily updated over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading pages THEN component rendering SHALL not cause performance degradation or layout shifts
2. WHEN updating design tokens THEN changes SHALL propagate consistently across all components without manual updates
3. WHEN adding new components THEN they SHALL follow established patterns and integrate seamlessly with existing components
4. WHEN removing legacy components THEN the system SHALL identify and clean up unused code automatically
5. WHEN building the application THEN the design system SHALL not significantly increase bundle size

### Requirement 7: Legacy Code Cleanup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove outdated and inconsistent UI code, so that the codebase is clean, maintainable, and follows current best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating to unified components THEN legacy component files SHALL be identified and removed safely
2. WHEN cleaning up styles THEN duplicate CSS and unused style definitions SHALL be eliminated
3. WHEN updating imports THEN all references to legacy components SHALL be updated to use unified components
4. WHEN removing old files THEN the system SHALL ensure no broken references or missing dependencies remain
5. WHEN completing cleanup THEN the codebase SHALL have a clear separation between unified components and any remaining legacy code that requires manual migration
