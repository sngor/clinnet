# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for optimizing the Clinnet EMR AWS architecture to improve efficiency and cost-effectiveness while maintaining performance, security, and scalability. The current system uses a hybrid approach with Aurora Serverless v2, DynamoDB, Lambda functions, API Gateway, S3, and CloudFront. The optimization should focus on right-sizing resources, consolidating databases where appropriate, optimizing Lambda configurations, and implementing cost-saving measures without compromising functionality.

2. WHEN optimizing CloudFront THEN the system SHALL configure appropriate caching strategies and price classes
3. WHEN managing medical documents THEN the system SHALL implement intelligent tiering for infrequently accessed files
4. WHEN optimizing image storage THEN the system SHALL implement compression and format optimization
5. WHEN implementing storage optimization THEN the system SHALL maintain data availability and access performance

### Requirement 4: API Gateway and Networking Optimization

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want to optimize API Gateway configuration and networking setup to reduce latency and costs, so that the system performs better at lower cost.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN evaluating API Gateway usage THEN the system SHALL optimize request/response caching where appropriate
2. WHEN analyzing VPC configuration THEN the system SHALL optimize NAT Gateway usage and consider VPC endpoints
3. WHEN optimizing networking THEN the system SHALL minimize data transfer costs between services
4. WHEN implementing API optimization THEN the system SHALL maintain current security and CORS configurations
5. WHEN optimizing network architecture THEN the system SHALL reduce unnecessary network hops and improve latency

### Requirement 5: Monitoring and Cost Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive cost monitoring and alerting to track optimization effectiveness and prevent cost overruns, so that I can maintain budget control and identify further optimization opportunities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing cost monitoring THEN the system SHALL provide detailed cost breakdown by service and environment
2. WHEN setting up alerts THEN the system SHALL notify administrators of unusual cost spikes or budget thresholds
3. WHEN tracking optimization THEN the system SHALL measure and report cost savings from implemented changes
4. WHEN monitoring performance THEN the system SHALL ensure optimizations don't negatively impact user experience
5. WHEN implementing cost controls THEN the system SHALL provide recommendations for further optimization

### Requirement 6: Environment-Specific Optimization

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want different optimization strategies for development, testing, and production environments to balance cost and functionality appropriately, so that each environment is optimized for its specific use case.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN optimizing development environment THEN the system SHALL minimize costs while maintaining development functionality
2. WHEN configuring test environment THEN the system SHALL balance cost with testing requirements
3. WHEN optimizing production environment THEN the system SHALL prioritize performance and availability over cost savings
4. WHEN implementing environment-specific settings THEN the system SHALL use appropriate resource sizing for each environment
5. WHEN managing multi-environment costs THEN the system SHALL provide clear cost allocation and tracking per environment

### Requirement 7: Security and Compliance Optimization

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want to maintain or improve security posture while optimizing costs, so that the system remains secure and compliant without unnecessary security-related expenses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN optimizing security services THEN the system SHALL maintain current security levels while reducing costs
2. WHEN evaluating encryption THEN the system SHALL use cost-effective encryption methods without compromising security
3. WHEN optimizing access controls THEN the system SHALL maintain least privilege principles while simplifying management
4. WHEN implementing security optimization THEN the system SHALL ensure HIPAA compliance requirements are maintained
5. WHEN managing security costs THEN the system SHALL identify and eliminate redundant security measures

### Requirement 8: Scalability and Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want to ensure that cost optimizations don't compromise the system's ability to scale and perform under varying loads, so that the system remains responsive and scalable while being cost-effective.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing cost optimizations THEN the system SHALL maintain current performance benchmarks
2. WHEN optimizing for scale THEN the system SHALL ensure auto-scaling capabilities are preserved or improved
3. WHEN reducing resource allocation THEN the system SHALL maintain acceptable response times under normal load
4. WHEN implementing performance optimization THEN the system SHALL improve efficiency without increasing costs
5. WHEN testing optimized architecture THEN the system SHALL demonstrate equivalent or better performance metrics
